## Usage

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');
var bundle = require('{%= name %}');

gulp.task('default', function() {
  return gulp.src('index.js')
    .pipe(bundle())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'));
});
```

## Why use this?

[Webtask.io](https://webtask.io) is a server that lets developers publish code to an endpoint that will be executed. They provide a [curated list of npm modules](https://tehsis.github.io/webtaskio-canirequire/) that can be used by default, but not every module is available. A developer can use [browserify][] and the `node` flag to bundle their code and publish the bundled code to [webtask][] but this will bundle all of the included modules (even the ones that webtask already supplies).

This plugin will provide the default options that match the `node` flag from the [browserify][] command line argument and exclude modules that are already supplied by webtask. This makes it easier to bundle and deploy code to webtask.io in a [gulp][], [assemble][], [generate][], or [verb][] workflow.
